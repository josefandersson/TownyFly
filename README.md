### TownyFly (Bukkit/Spigot plugin)
##### Allows players to fly within the borders of the town they reside in.

Players with the permission "townyfly.toggle.self" can use "/townyfly" ("/tfly" works too) to enable flying in their town. The command works in the same way as Essentials "/fly" but disables flying whenever a player leaves their town.

Requires Towny to work.
